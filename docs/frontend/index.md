# Frontend overview

Lessy's frontend is written with VueJS and is built with NPM and Webpack. You
can find the code under the `client/` directory. Please refer to the [VueJS
guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) to get started with it.

Our design guide is accessible at [lessy.io/design](https://lessy.io/design),
please always refer to it when working on the frontend.

We describe general guidelines to test the frontend in [a specific
document](writing_tests.md).

This documentation is still under construction. Later, we will document:

- what is and how to write generic components
- how to organize components
- how to write good store's module
- localisation
