# Frontend overview

Lessy's frontend is written with VueJS and is built with NPM and Webpack. You
can find the code under the `client/` directory.

Since **we are planning to rebuild the frontend from scratch**, this
documentation will stay empty for the moment.

Later, we will document:

- graphical charter
- what is and how to write generic components
- how to organize components
- how to write good store's module
- localisation
- how to write tests
