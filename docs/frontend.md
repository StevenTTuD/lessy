# Frontend overview

Lessy's frontend is written with VueJS and is built with NPM and Webpack. You
can find the code under the `client/` directory.

Since **we are currently rebuilding the frontend from scratch**, this
documentation will stay empty for the moment.

Our design guide is accessible at [lessy.io/design](https://lessy.io/design),
please always refer to it when working on the frontend.

Later, we will document:

- graphical charter
- what is and how to write generic components
- how to organize components
- how to write good store's module
- localisation
- how to write tests
